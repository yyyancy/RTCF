# Robust Tensor Completion with Side Information

This code repository is dedicated to the implementation of **Robust Tensor Completion with Side Information**  and contains the MATLAB implementation of the following three algorithms:

1. ITCNF (Inductive Tensor Completion with Noisy Features)

2. TPCPNF (Tensor Principal Component Pursuit with Noisy Features)

3. TPCPNF - part (TPCPNF Algorithm with Partial Observations)
